# Jets Application

### Overview
An interactive program that uses OOP and Java fundamentals to read jets from file, adds them to a squadron, displays their model, speed, range, type, price and distance traveled. Jet types make use of abstract classes, interfaces, and overridden methods. The AirField class stores and organizes the jets. Additionally, from the interactive menu, the user can load cargojets, fight fighterjets, and retrieve fastest and the jet with longest range. The user can add new jets to the program and remove jets by their uniquie ID. 

### Technologies Used
- Java
- OOP
- Abstract Classes
- Interfaces

### How to Run
Run the program and interact with the menu options to access all functions of the application.

### Lessons Learned
The benefit of designing a UML diagram is very clear. This program was a valuable experience for practicing object oriented programming and abstract classses, interfaces, and file IO operations.
